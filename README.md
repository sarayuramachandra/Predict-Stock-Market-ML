This is a Machine Learning practice project
I use the yahoo finance (yfinance) API to import all the stock market data history
I use predictors of the rolling averages to predict based on historical data if the 
market will go up or down tomorrow for the sp500 index

This implements a random forest algorithm from sklearn.ensemble
